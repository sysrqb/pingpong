In no particular order:

- ncurses output with current stats
- HTTP status interface and administrative control (which may be a hidden
  service itself)
  - Either third-party lib or custom-written linkable lib
- autoconf setup - 10/01/12
- Configuration file
- Add an authorization mechanism, mostlikely using the symmetric descriptor
  cookie mentioned in the Rendezvous spec section 2.1, but this methods is
  not set in stone.
- Write unit tests?
- Add easy-use implementation for sending X form of communication if peer
  is no longer reachable (where X may be email or similar)
- Update command line parser to support reordering and both long and short
  options, i.e. -h and --help
