pingpong: Simple echo request/reply client/server that passes requests via
          SOCKS 5 proxy. The intended use is via Tor where the server is
	  a Hidden Service, but there exist numerous alternative use cases

Note: This is still under heavy development.


Use Case:
  Similar purpose to Tor Weather, but can be distributed across a diverse
  environment and maintain anonymity.
  
Personal Reason:
  The reason I decided to write this is because I have a laptop that is an
  OR however it's wireless connection is not stable. By implementing this
  it will allow me to have an automated response to the network becoming
  unavailable.

License:
  I am releasing this code under the terms of AGPL due to the server
  portion.
